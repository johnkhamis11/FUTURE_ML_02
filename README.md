# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

**Future Interns - Machine Learning Internship (Task 2)**

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical data and a simple regression model.

---

## 🔍 Objective

- Predict the next-day **closing price** of a stock using previous data.
- Visualize predicted vs actual prices.
- Evaluate model performance using **RMSE**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Sample historical stock data for **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**
